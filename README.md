# Obtaining the most profit from at most K number of transactions

In this project I apply some dynamic programming techniques in order to solve the problem 
[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/) from LeetCode.com

In order to view the project simply open the jupyter notebook max-profit-with-k-transactions.ipynb, everything else is explained within it.

However if GitHub refuses to render the notebook, you may view it at this [NBVIEWER LINK](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JustCallMeRob/most-profit-with-k-transactions/blob/main/max-profit-with-k-transactions.ipynb)

This project represents the capstone project for the online course on [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python)
provided by Jovian.ml.

Special thanks to [Aakash N S](https://medium.com/@aakashns) and the rest of the Jovian.ml crew that made the course possible.
